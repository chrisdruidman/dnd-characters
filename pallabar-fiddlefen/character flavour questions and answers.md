Pallabar is admitting he is coasting.

Pallabar has worked with alchemical tools for a long time so is not bothered by needles, but he's naturally bound to be nervously excited before testing out new things - gnomes are known for their curiosity after all.

His talkative nature doesn't change, but he won't directly admit to the party what he's doing, and will attempt to keep the journals private at all times. The talkative nature is actually part of his defence tactics - talk about so many things so quickly that whoever he is talking to gets overwhelmed and wants to end the conversation!
