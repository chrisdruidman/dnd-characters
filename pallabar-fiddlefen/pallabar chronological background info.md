#pallabar chronological background 

The following is information about Pallabar Fiddlefen's background, presented in chronological order from discord conversations with my DM.

##Pallabar's initial background 

Born and raised in Eldergleam.

Family was poor and lived in an apartment in a rundown neighbourhood. Can be a bit selfish due to growing up poor.

Reason for becoming an artificer - I wanted to get away from my home situation and start a new life. Wanted to live a better life than his parents.

Believes that any person should be able to work to have the same opportunities he has been given. He feels the average citizen deserves the freedom to pursue this however they wish.

Pallabar has a great bond to his guild. He feels he owes them a great debt for the training he has received, and the circumstances he now finds himself in - no longer poor, gained a vast amount of knowledge.

##Starting Knowledge

As a resident of Eldergleam during your lifetime, you know your way around the city and know some of it's history.

- You know the Eldergleam Spire is off limits to civilians.
- The Eldergleam Spire is mostly occupied by human wizards - They wear unique red robes.
- Mayor of the city = Half-orc named Gor'dan.
- You know about your guild, but this will have to be expanded on at a later date.

A history:

Eldergleam was founded on a leyline of potent magical energy, a force said to have been forged by the swing of a God's weapon, which carved the very continent itself. Drawn to this nexus of arcane power, a group of Elder Wizards settled in the area, driven by a desire to harness and control the immense magic coursing through the land. These pioneers established Eldergleam as a beacon of magical study and mastery, building their city atop the leyline to manifest and wield the mystical energies to their fullest potential. Their legacy endures, with Eldergleam standing as a testament to their profound knowledge and arcane prowess.

##Local knowledge

As someone who lives in Eldergleam, you know of a very popular inn in the central plaza, called the spellweaver's rest. And would think of it as a good place to spend the evening to wind down. There are rooms available for those that need somewhere to stay.

##Guild note on a rare plant he encountered

From Alchemist department of the artificer guild:

You are aware of a rare plant they use called lullabloom. It is only found in the feywild and is hard to get hold of on this plane because of this. But you do have small amounts at the alchemy guild. You know it properties can cause mild psychosis, sleepiness and heightened emotions.

##Some questions on eldergleam and DM answers

Me:
Hmmm questions: I know that the mages control the central area, and last session we visited that area and went into an alchemist shop.

So what are the guilds' relationship with the mages of the city?

 Would that shop be under the control of the mages or the guild? Or perhaps both?

Me:
Trying to define the reasons as to why the guild exists in the city lol, and I came across those questions whilst thinking ðŸ˜‚

Me:
Another thought related to this: 

I was thinking one of the reasons would be to control access and use of certain alchemical ingredients in Eldergleam, otherwise you would have uncontrolled alchemy everywhere and that would most likely cause chaos.

How would the lullabloom fit into this? There's small amounts of it in the guild, but there was another inn found in the central area (I think you said it was there lol) that uses it in the guest rooms, so would that come under the mages authority?

Me:
Sorry if I'm making things difficult for you ðŸ˜…

DM:
That's fine, the questions are good for both of us, as it lets me think about things I may not have thought about before...

So the central area, including the Eldergleam spire, is mage/wizard heavy, its like a headquarters, but also a school. It's where the the Elders reside (within the spire), who I guess are a bit like a council, but they're all top of the food chain. It's like there being a king, except 5 of them are in charge rather than 1 (There may be a name for this but I can't think of it right now ðŸ˜„ ). - I guess it's like a king and his council, except there is no single person above the rest. Not sure if that all makes sense ðŸ˜… 
   Adding on to this, wizards also study here, there's libraries, training grounds etc. So there's a combination of mages that are authority, and mages that are students, but distinguishing between the 2 can be difficult. You're unlikely to see students in mage robes away from the spire.

What are the guilds relationship to the mages and the shops? If you think of the mages as the police force or soldiers, I guess they fall into that category, they are the authority but they're not necessarily in charge of the shops, they're still run by people making a living. The alchemist shop probably buys it's stock from the guild. The shops you visited were near the Spire and the Civic Ward (places with "government" buildings). so it was a bit more of an upmarket area, or even student area for the mages...

DM:
Reasons why the guild exists... I guess firstly this would include innovation, science and development and defence systems. The other departments include a lot of creation for weapons and armour, so I think this fits in. Some create cannons and ballistics, some make automated robots, archivists are about storing information, so infusing AI with magic.

I like the idea of alchemists controlling the access and use of certain ingredients, especially more potent ones. These can once again be used as a weapons etc, as you can make explosive things, such as Alchemist fire and Blasting Powder,  which may be prohibited outside the guild, but other ingredients can be linked to things such as potion of climbing or pixie dust, which may be useful to people. 

Lullabloom is extremally rare on the material plane, as it's only found in the feywild, but with contacts and resources, the alchemist guild can sometimes procure some. Yes, there's an inn near the center, so probably relatively close to the shops you were at, called the Celestial Haven. I like the idea that the Alchemist department would have some sort of control over this, so maybe they provide a licence for that specific place to use a product of the herb (it's a little like a psychedelic drug), which causes all the effects you experienced. It's expensive which is why it's only outsourced to the one place, and near the center where the wealthy/government officials/mages have easy access to it.

DM:
Also, I'm not sure if you've seen the link to the potion book that Kiara put in, but that has lots of ingredients towards the end which are the ones I'll stick to for ease, + there's lullabloom. 

You will start at lv 2 potion making, as you do have prior experience. and off the top of your head you will know 3 common alchemist recipes. If you require more recipes it's often a monetary value for the recipe. There may be some sort of exception at the guild. It can be a little confusing and a lot of information to look at first time, but I'll try and simplify a bit more when we get to it.

##Pallabar guild questions/answers

Is his abode at the guild? or does he have a place within Eldergleam?
**The guild has accommodation of various sizes, depending on where you rank - apprentices and 1st rank members have access to large shared dorms, 2nd rank members are able to move into smaller shared dorms of 2-4 people, 3rd rank members are able to gain a tiny singular room attached to a small personal lab - there is more lab space than personal space. Ranks above 3rd rank gain access to larger labs with larger personal spaces as rank increases. Heads of departments and the guildmaster have access to a personal room and a separate personal lab. Of course, members are allowed to live/own/use property outside of the guild but it is considered a little unusual given the convenience of the guild supplies.**
**Pallabar lives at the guild. He has worked up to 3rd rank (*if that's agreeable*)so has his own tiny room attached to a small lab**

How long has he been a part of it? (In his backstory you mention he feels he owes them a great debt for training, so must be some length of time)
**Pallabar has been a member of the guild for a long time. He started messing around with alchemy from the young age of 14 after finding a dropped alchemists book in one of Eldergleam's markets at a young age. Instead of returning the book, he instead started learning as much as he could from it, recognising the opportunity to grasp a different path than his tinkerer parents who scraped by doing odd jobs whenever possible.**
**By the time Pallabar was 15 he was considered a 'regular' at the guild due to his constant trips to purchase supplies, ask anyone who was there alchemy questions, and perusing the job board for any small tasks he could possibly tackle(*the job board would have jobs from each of the departments, with certain jobs only being available to guild members, which allows the general citizen to help out the guild/get money from jobs if they so desire*).**
**Pallabar joined the guild officially at 16, and has never left. This means he has been a guild member for 124 YEARS, and has gained a massive amount of knowledge as well as a small amount of personal wealth during that time!**

What people does he know/ what are his relations like with them?
**Pallabar has been around long enough to have met most current members at least once. There is a piece of common knowledge around the guild - "Engage Pallabar Fiddlefen in conversation at your own peril", as obviously he will talk anyone's ear off and prevent them from going about their day!**
**Pallabar does not generally work with the Weaponsmiths or Defence departments as there hasn't been a large crossover in his work, as he mainly focuses on his alchemy, talking, organising trades, seeking information, talking, socialising, talking, gathering favours, and talking.**
**Pallabar does interact with the Science and Technology department, mainly the archivists, as he regularly seeks information from the guild vaults for his various dealings**
**The guildmaster knows Pallabar - having been around long enough to have seen some members' entire careers begin and end, it would have been impossible for the guildmaster to avoid him. They have spent many an hour being spoken at by Pallabar**
**The head of the Alchemy department knows Pallabar very well - in fact they sometimes wish they had more of a boundary as they have lost many hours of work to Pallabar's questions and requests**
**The guild reception team (*in charge of onboarding, organising guild job requests, handling messages etc*) knows Pallabar extremely well, to the point where they specially acquired a sand timer to limit the time they have to deal with him**

- **Relationship with Pallabar:** Pallabar and Mirabella share a bond through their love of alchemy. Mirabella is one of the few who can listen to Pallabarâ€™s ramblings without growing frustrated, often finding nuggets of wisdom in his lengthy explanations. She has a maternal-like care for him, though she gently tries to steer him away from monopolizing the guildâ€™s time. They have a strong professional relationship, and she admires his dedication.
  
- **Leadership Style:** Mirabella leads with compassion and collaboration. She believes that the guild functions best when everyone feels supported and that progress comes through shared knowledge. Sheâ€™s often seen working directly with members, solving problems as a team.

```Thovius 'The Hammer' Bronzekept```
Armorer leader 

**Race:** Goliath  
**Class:** Artificer (Armorer)  
**Personality:** Stoic, Strong, Pragmatic

- **Appearance:** Thovius is a massive figure, standing well over seven feet tall with gray skin etched with intricate tattoos. His muscular build is matched by the heavy armor he often wears, which is of his own creation, fitted with all manner of magical enhancements. His arms are as thick as tree trunks, and his deep-set eyes are calm and observant.
  
- **Personality:** Thovius is stoic and pragmatic, believing in function over form in all things. He doesnâ€™t waste words, and when he speaks, itâ€™s direct and to the point. Heâ€™s a strong leader who commands respect through his actions, often leading by example in the forge or on the battlefield. Though not outwardly emotional, Thovius cares deeply about the guild and its members, protecting them like a family.
  
- **Relationship with Pallabar:** Thovius tolerates Pallabarâ€™s chatter but is not particularly interested in long conversations. He appreciates the gnomeâ€™s skill in alchemy but wishes heâ€™d be more succinct. That said, Thovius does recognize Pallabarâ€™s contributions to the guild and occasionally seeks him out for alchemical advice.
  
- **Leadership Style:** Thovius is a hands-on leader, often found working alongside the guildâ€™s armorsmiths and battlesmiths. He leads through action and expects others to follow his example. Though not one for grand speeches or visionary projects, heâ€™s steadfast and reliable, keeping the guild grounded in practical achievements.

```Zorra Ethaliar```
Artillerist Leader 

**Race:** High Elf  
**Class:** Artificer (Artillerist)  
**Personality:** Creative, Analytical, Magnetic

- **Appearance:** Zorra has striking, angular features, with silver hair that flows down her back like liquid metal. Her violet eyes seem to crackle with energy, constantly studying her surroundings. She is tall and graceful, wearing robes embedded with magical circuitry that faintly glows as she moves. A set of mechanical gauntlets, etched with glowing runes, rests on her hands, a signature invention of hers that allows for precision spellcasting and engineering work.
    
- **Personality:** Zorra is a creative force, always at the cutting edge of arcane technology. Sheâ€™s brilliant but practical, mixing artistry with cold, analytical thinking. Zorra values the intersection of magic and science and has a flair for invention. Her personality is magnetic, easily drawing people to her through her charismatic vision for the future of the guild. Despite her charm, she can be exacting and occasionally arrogant, expecting the same level of perfection she demands of herself from others.
    
- **Relationship with Pallabar:** Zorra enjoys Pallabarâ€™s extensive knowledge of alchemy, and while she occasionally finds his ramblings distracting, she recognizes his potential for contribution to larger projects. Theyâ€™ve collaborated on a few experimental mixtures, and she appreciates his dedication, though she often cuts him short when his tangents begin. She sees Pallabar as a resource, a wealth of obscure knowledge she can tap into when needed.

- **Leadership Style:** Zorra leads with vision and precision. Sheâ€™s often the one pushing the guild into new realms of innovation, unafraid to take bold risks if it means advancing their understanding of arcane technology. She encourages creativity among her guild members but insists on careful planning and flawless execution. Zorraâ€™s leadership is inspiring but can be intimidating, as she expects everyone to keep up with her quick thinking and lofty goals.

```Master Cylvyn 'Ironhand' Glimmsteel```
Battlesmith Leader 

**Race:** Dwarf  
**Class:** Artificer (Battle Smith)  
**Personality:** Gruff, No-Nonsense, Disciplined

- **Appearance:** A stout dwarf with a long silver beard braided into intricate patterns. He has a mechanical prosthetic arm, a highly advanced creation of his own design, which gives him the moniker "Ironhand." His eyes gleam with a mix of wisdom and experience, and his skin is scarred from years of experiments and battle.
  
- **Personality:** Cylvyn is a no-nonsense leader with a strong belief in discipline and efficiency. He values the guild's work above all else and has little patience for idle chatter, which makes him the frequent (and sometimes exasperated) target of Pallabar's endless conversations. He has a sharp mind, preferring practical applications of magic and technology over theoretical discussions.
  
- **Relationship with Pallabar:** Cylvyn respects Pallabar's knowledge and dedication but wishes heâ€™d focus more on results than endless theorizing. Pallabarâ€™s constant talking tends to get on Cylvynâ€™s nerves, though he admits that the gnome has proven useful in key situations. The two have a professional relationship with occasional humorous (and frustrating) exchanges.
  
- **Leadership Style:** Cylvyn runs the guild with a military-like precision. He expects the best from everyone and isn't afraid to confront problems head-on. However, he does have a softer side, particularly for guild members who show innovation and determination. He's known to reward excellence and encourage progress.

##Pallabar's state of mind/thoughts 

For a couple of years now, Pallabar has had a small nagging thought in the back of his head - perhaps he should be further along in the guild by now. He's been a member for 124 years for gods' sake! But he's sure he is comfortable with his lifestyle, looking into his different bits of research and making his little deals around the city.

The problem now is that he's fallen in with a group of 'keen adventurers' (this is what Pallabar thinks of the group lol) which has been amplifying the feeling. He's taking work directly from the mayor himself! Even a year ago he would never had imagined he would have this kind of opportunity.

Even worse is Kiara. He's taken her under his alchemical wing, but he only regularly does alchemy that's barely above a basic level. Sure, he can identify a lot of ingredients and knows where to source them outside of the guild. But he has now realising it is a little embarrassing, as a 'mentor', to not be able to pass on more knowledge.

Perhaps, maybe, just possibly, it's time for Pallabar to get his shit together. Not that he will admit this to anyone, not even the group lol. He's unsure of the steps to achieve this so he will sound unsure/nervous as he's doing certain things.

##My ideas for the character theme

I want to try to lean into the mad scientist side of alchemy, when I was thinking of the type of character I wanted to play I was imagining something like the N. Brio fight from crash bandicoot ðŸ˜‚

here's a clip to explain https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dC_1US_1tc

so as part of Pallabar finally getting his act together, I wanted to make him go back to some research that he "put aside" many years ago as he started getting too comfortable

he's always known he's not the strongest, or fastest, or many other things

but he realised early on that alchemy can give him advantages in those areas, and the best thing is that he can share these gifts by creating potions etc

however, he really wanted to experiment with.... more direct applications of elixirs, and so was working on a design of a device that allows vials to be injected directly into the body. It would end up looking like the vita-saw from tf2 - https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/6/6e/RED_%C3%9Cberneedle.png - or the needle gun thing from bioshock - https://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/a/ae/Bioshock_Needle.png

I want Pallabar to move in with everyone else and he's going to leave everything in his lab behind, save for an old journal from his younger days that contains his notes and research into body altering alchemy, and an even older journal that has someone else's handwriting as well as Pallabar's that contains the alchemic gun design (might think of a different name lol, open to suggestions). I'm thinking to add to part of his backstory, when he finds the basic alchemy book dropped in the street, that this older journal was also strapped to it. Pallabar's flaw in needing to get his hands on rare things and knowledge meant he never attempted to find the original owner

If you're happy with that, then as part of Pallabar moving in I'd like for him to be able to work on building the gun whenever we're resting there

and maybe he can complete it when we're level 6? or something, I want it to be worked towards lol

Either way, I'd like to flavour Pallabars spells and infusions as bio-chemic stuff, and I want to change him into a melee character, so I'll change some of his spells to help in melee situations and use infusions enhance him in melee combat ðŸ˜„ so his spells etc would be vials of stuff he drinks lol

For the flavour, I'll probably take some inspiration from this homebrew I saw quite a few recommendations for, specifically the Biomancer:
