### Melee – Alter Self (Natural Weapons)

**RAW (Strength-based)**  
- Attack Bonus: **+1** (STR -2 + Proficiency +3)  
- Damage: **1d6 - 2** (Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing; magic)  

**DM-Ruled (INT-based, alchemical enhancement)**  
- Attack Bonus: **+6** (INT +3 + Proficiency +3)  
- Damage: **1d6 + 3** (Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing; magic)  
- *Summary:* This uses Intelligence instead of Strength for attack and damage rolls, representing chemically boosted strikes. Identical in principle to the Battle Smith Artificer’s “Battle Ready” feature, but applied to Alter Self’s natural weapons for theme. Boosts hit chance and damage compared to STR-based attacks.

---

## Background

### Early Life
- Born into poverty in Eldergleam, lived in a cramped apartment.  
- At age 14, found a dropped alchemy book and an older mysterious journal with a second handwriting. Kept both, starting a lifetime of self-taught experimentation.  
- Driven by a desire to escape his upbringing and make something of himself.

### Guild Career
- Joined the Guild of Alchemists at 16, now a 124-year member and 3rd rank artificer.  
- Lives in a tiny private room with a small lab in the guild complex.  
- Known as a “living library” but also for his relentless chatter — to the point the reception desk uses a sand timer to limit conversations.  
- Maintains cordial if varied relationships with department heads:  
  - **Mirabella Thorne** (Alchemy): Maternal support, patience with his rambling.  
  - **Sorin Valtor** (Guild Leader): Values his encyclopedic mind.  
  - Others tolerate him but often cut conversations short.

---

## Current Crisis – “The Coasting Revelation”
- Realizes he’s stagnated: still basic alchemy after 124 years.  
- Mentoring Kiara has highlighted his lack of advanced practical knowledge.  
- Feels like a mascot in the guild rather than a respected contributor.  
- Determined, privately, to change — without admitting it to anyone.

---

## Bio-Chemical Transformation Plan
- **Goal:** Shift from support caster to melee-capable alchemist.  
- **Method:** Develop an **Injection Device** to deliver alchemical compounds directly into the body.  
- **Applications:** Combat stims, defensive boosters, sensory enhancers, temporary mutations.  
- **Timeline:** Prototype by level 6; progress through small breakthroughs during downtime.  
- **Flavour:** Spells flavoured as chemical injections or potions drunk mid-fight.

---

## Journals
- **Journal 1:** Personal research on body-altering alchemy — symbol of lost ambition.  
- **Journal 2:** Injection device designs from unknown co-author — possible plot hook.  
- Both are secret from the party; Pallabar deflects questions and guards them obsessively.

---

## Flavour & Roleplay Cues
- Comfortable with needles and tools, but nervously excited before trials.  
- Deflects personal inquiries with enthusiastic alchemical tangents.  
- Uses physical cues (fidgeting, supply re-organisation) when hiding discomfort.  
- Increasingly shows signs of late-night work, frustration, and distracted behaviour.

## Combat Tactics (Level 5 Melee Mad Scientist)

### Pre-Combat Prep
- **Buffs before entering danger** (if possible):
  - *Longstrider* (1 hr) — +10 ft movement
  - *Alter Self* (Natural Weapons) — melee mode active
  - **Experimental Elixirs:**  
    - *Resilience* (+AC) if expecting heavy fire  
    - *Swiftness* (speed boost) for mobility  
    - *Boldness* (+attack rolls) for offense
  - *False Life* (temp HP) if time allows

### Opening Moves
- Bonus Action: *Expeditious Retreat* to engage or reposition  
- Action: Strike with natural weapons or deploy *Web* / *Blur* to control the field  
- Use *Flaming Sphere* early to create a persistent hazard

### Sustaining the Fight
- Stay in melee — natural weapons require no materials and keep hands free  
- *Arcane Vigor* to refresh temp HP during lulls  
- *Shocking Grasp* to disengage safely  
- *Thorn Whip* to drag foes into hazards or within melee range

### Reactive Play
- *Absorb Elements* (if available via item or scroll) to reduce elemental damage  
- Use positioning to threaten vulnerable targets

### Post-Combat
- Roll **Mutation Backlash** after *Alter Self* ends  
- Brew replacement elixirs during short rests if resources allow

### Target Priority
1. Spellcasters & Controllers — break concentration quickly  
2. Lightly Armored Ranged — eliminate before they can kite you  
3. Enemies in Hazard Zones — keep them trapped with control spells and reach attacks

## Pressure Cooker Development Plan
Four-phase escalation from subtle behavioural changes to revelation of his secret project:

1. **Subtle Shift:** Fidgeting, faster chatter when deflecting, mild paranoia over journals.  
2. **Cracks Show:** Sleep deprivation, visible frustration, vague “personal project” references.  
3. **Pressure Builds:** Avoidance, visible exhaustion, first prototype appears.  
4. **Breaking Point:** Facade collapses; revelation via discovery, failure, or confrontation.

---

## Campaign Integration Hooks
- Missions from the mayor increase his perceived importance.  
- Mirabella’s concern provides social pressure.  
- Guild visits are constant reminders of his stagnation.  
- Prototype device marks progression toward Level 6 goals.
