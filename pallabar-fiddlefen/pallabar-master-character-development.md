## Core Stats (Level 5)

| STR | DEX | CON | INT | WIS | CHA |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 7 (-2) | 11 (+0) | 12 (+1) | 17 (+3) | 9 (-1) | 16 (+3) |

- **Proficiency Bonus:** +3  
- **AC:** 12 (Studded Leather, Dex +0) | 13 if using +1 Studded Leather infusion

- **Speed:** 25 ft

### Melee – Alter Self (Natural Weapons)

**RAW (Strength-based)**  
- Attack Bonus: **+1** (STR -2 + Proficiency +3)  
- Damage: **1d6 - 2** (Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing; magic)  

**DM-Ruled (INT-based, alchemical enhancement)**  
- Attack Bonus: **+6** (INT +3 + Proficiency +3)  
- Damage: **1d6 + 3** (Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing; magic)  
- *Summary:* This uses Intelligence instead of Strength for attack and damage rolls, representing chemically boosted strikes. Identical in principle to the Battle Smith Artificer’s “Battle Ready” feature, but applied to Alter Self’s natural weapons for theme. Boosts hit chance and damage compared to STR-based attacks.

## Personality
- **Traits:** Always curious about how things work; talks at length about his profession.  
- **Ideals:** Freedom — Everyone should be able to pursue their livelihood.  
- **Bonds:** Deep loyalty to the guild for changing his life.  
- **Flaws:** Will do anything to acquire something rare or priceless.  
- **Behavioral Quirk:** Uses rapid, overwhelming conversation to control interactions and deflect personal questions.

---

## Background

### Early Life
- Born into poverty in Eldergleam, lived in a cramped apartment.  
- At age 14, found a dropped alchemy book and an older mysterious journal with a second handwriting. Kept both, starting a lifetime of self-taught experimentation.  
- Driven by a desire to escape his upbringing and make something of himself.

### Guild Career
- Joined the Guild of Alchemists at 16, now a 124-year member and 3rd rank artificer.  
- Lives in a tiny private room with a small lab in the guild complex.  
- Known as a “living library” but also for his relentless chatter — to the point the reception desk uses a sand timer to limit conversations.  
- Maintains cordial if varied relationships with department heads:  
  - **Mirabella Thorne** (Alchemy): Maternal support, patience with his rambling.  
  - **Sorin Valtor** (Guild Leader): Values his encyclopedic mind.  
  - Others tolerate him but often cut conversations short.

---

## Current Crisis – “The Coasting Revelation”
- Realizes he’s stagnated: still basic alchemy after 124 years.  
- Mentoring Kiara has highlighted his lack of advanced practical knowledge.  
- Feels like a mascot in the guild rather than a respected contributor.  
- Determined, privately, to change — without admitting it to anyone.

---

## Bio-Chemical Transformation Plan
- **Goal:** Shift from support caster to melee-capable alchemist.  
- **Method:** Develop an **Injection Device** to deliver alchemical compounds directly into the body.  
- **Applications:** Combat stims, defensive boosters, sensory enhancers, temporary mutations.  
- **Timeline:** Prototype by level 6; progress through small breakthroughs during downtime.  
- **Flavour:** Spells flavoured as chemical injections or potions drunk mid-fight.

---

## Journals
- **Journal 1:** Personal research on body-altering alchemy — symbol of lost ambition.  
- **Journal 2:** Injection device designs from unknown co-author — possible plot hook.  
- Both are secret from the party; Pallabar deflects questions and guards them obsessively.

---

## Flavour & Roleplay Cues
- Comfortable with needles and tools, but nervously excited before trials.  
- Deflects personal inquiries with enthusiastic alchemical tangents.  
- Uses physical cues (fidgeting, supply re-organisation) when hiding discomfort.  
- Increasingly shows signs of late-night work, frustration, and distracted behaviour.

## Mutations

Pallabar’s alchemical tinkering can warp his form—intentionally through *Alter Self (Natural Weapons)* or chaotically via mutation backlash.

### 1. Unstable Alter Self Mutations (1d8)
When casting *Alter Self (Natural Weapons)*, roll 1d8 for mutation form:

| d8 | Mutation | Type | Description |
|----|----------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Glass-Edge Digits | Claws (Slashing) | Fingernails become translucent, razor-sharp glass shards. |
| 2 | Rotary Bone Saws | Claws (Slashing) | Fingertips sprout spinning keratin saw-blades. |
| 3 | Vial-Jaw Injector | Fangs (Piercing) | Canines elongate into hollow syringes glowing with alchemical fluid. |
| 4 | Crystal Drill Fangs | Fangs (Piercing) | Spiral crystal fangs vibrate like miniature drills. |
| 5 | Copper Coil Antlers | Horns (Piercing) | Twisted copper tubing horns vent puffs of steam on contact. |
| 6 | Volcanic Spikes | Horns (Piercing) | Basalt horns crack with glowing magma veins, occasionally sparking. |
| 7 | Brass-Tipped Stompers | Hooves (Bludgeoning) | Hoof-caps of polished brass ring like muted bells on impact. |
| 8 | Geyser Steps | Hooves (Bludgeoning) | Mineral-packed hooves release hissing steam bursts with each stomp. |

### 2. Side-Effects (1d6)
After rolling mutation, roll 1d6 to add a harmless sensory quirk:

| d6 | Side Effect |
|----|-------------|
| 1 | **Aromatic Vapour** – Releases a distinctive scent (e.g., sulfur, cinnamon). |
| 2 | **Luminescent Glow** – Glows faintly, casting dim light in a 5-ft radius. |
| 3 | **Fizzling Residue** – Harmless alchemical foam drips and vanishes. |
| 4 | **Chromatic Shimmer** – Surface shifts colours like oil on water. |
| 5 | **Audible Ticking** – A soft *tick-tick* like clockwork echoes. |
| 6 | **Spore Cloud** – Harmless spores puff out on solid impact. |

### 3. Mutation Backlash (1d6)
When *Alter Self* ends or after combat, roll for uncontrolled mutation effects:

| d6 | Backlash Effect |
|----|-----------------|
| 1 | Green glow (1 h) |
| 2 | Tremors (10 min) |
| 3 | Manic laughter (1 h) |
| 4 | Dilated pupils (10 min) |
| 5 | Minor chemical burn |
| 6 | Stable — optional +1 attack until end of next turn **or** 2 temp HP |

### 4. Instability Mechanic (Optional)
At the **end of each of Pallabar’s turns**:
- Roll 1d6:
  - **1–2** → Mutation destabilises: reroll on both the *Mutations* and *Side-Effects* tables.
  - **3–6** → Mutation holds until the start of his next turn.
- Should a destabilisation occur mid-combat, the DM may also allow a *Mutation Backlash* roll for added chaos.

## Combat Tactics (Level 5 Melee Mad Scientist)

### Pre-Combat Prep
- **Buffs before entering danger** (if possible):
  - *Longstrider* (1 hr) — +10 ft movement
  - *Alter Self* (Natural Weapons) — melee mode active
  - **Experimental Elixirs:**  
    - *Resilience* (+AC) if expecting heavy fire  
    - *Swiftness* (speed boost) for mobility  
    - *Boldness* (+attack rolls) for offense
  - *False Life* (temp HP) if time allows

### Opening Moves
- Bonus Action: *Expeditious Retreat* to engage or reposition  
- Action: Strike with natural weapons or deploy *Web* / *Blur* to control the field  
- Use *Flaming Sphere* early to create a persistent hazard

### Sustaining the Fight
- Stay in melee — natural weapons require no materials and keep hands free  
- *Arcane Vigor* to refresh temp HP during lulls  
- *Shocking Grasp* to disengage safely  
- *Thorn Whip* to drag foes into hazards or within melee range

### Reactive Play
- *Absorb Elements* (if available via item or scroll) to reduce elemental damage  
- Use positioning to threaten vulnerable targets

### Post-Combat
- Roll **Mutation Backlash** after *Alter Self* ends  
- Brew replacement elixirs during short rests if resources allow

### Target Priority
1. Spellcasters & Controllers — break concentration quickly  
2. Lightly Armored Ranged — eliminate before they can kite you  
3. Enemies in Hazard Zones — keep them trapped with control spells and reach attacks

## Pressure Cooker Development Plan
Four-phase escalation from subtle behavioural changes to revelation of his secret project:

1. **Subtle Shift:** Fidgeting, faster chatter when deflecting, mild paranoia over journals.  
2. **Cracks Show:** Sleep deprivation, visible frustration, vague “personal project” references.  
3. **Pressure Builds:** Avoidance, visible exhaustion, first prototype appears.  
4. **Breaking Point:** Facade collapses; revelation via discovery, failure, or confrontation.

---

## Campaign Integration Hooks
- Missions from the mayor increase his perceived importance.  
- Mirabella’s concern provides social pressure.  
- Guild visits are constant reminders of his stagnation.  
- Prototype device marks progression toward Level 6 goals.
